### Importing your character spritesheet

The first thing is to choose a spritesheet. You can use any of the spritesheets in this repo's Sprites folder, or anything else that follows the "LPC" format. For other size spritesheets these instructions would be slightly different. <br>
<br>
Go to the Projects pane, right click and create folder "Characters". Double click to open the folder in the pane. <br>
<br>
Drag and drop spritesheet of choice into the folder, then click on it to open up Inspector view. <br>
<br>
Make the following changes:
* Change sprite mode from Single to Multiple. This is to tell Unity this is a spritesheet with multiple sprites within it.
* Change Pixels per Unit to 32. This indicates the height and width of a single “cell” or tile. 
* Go to advanced and change Filter Mode to “Point (no filter)” This is important for pixel art! Otherwise it will appear blurry.
