## Set up interface

![](/WorkshopImages/UnityInterface.png)

If your screen does not look like above, I recommend this configuration.<br>
* Scene and Game panes in center.
* Hierarchy on left.
* Project and console on bottom
* Inspector on right

## Explanation of Tools

### Toolbar

*	Hand – pans around the scene
*	Move (cross) – moves objects within scene
*	Rotate (cycle) – rotates objects on x, y, or z axis
*	Scale (arrows expanding) – shrink or expand objects maintaining scale
*	Rect Transform (box) – shrink or expand objects while distorting scale
*	Transform (cross circle) – combines Move, Rotate, and Scale
* Center/Pivot - affects pivot position for Game Objects
* Local/Global - affects relative position of Game Objects
*	Play/Pause/Step – play or pause the game
* Collab - for syncing a project with other collaborators
* Unity Services (cloud) - access to business tools like analytics
*	Account – access your account settings
* Layers - view the layers of the scene
*	Layout – current interface setup (save current as basic)

### Project Pane
