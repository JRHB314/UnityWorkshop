# Unity Workshop

For those who are interested in Unity but don't know where to start.

## Set Up

First, download and install Unity. The [personal edition](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) of Unity is all you need for this. 

You'll also need to create a Unity account. You can either do that on the website or after you open up the Unity program. 

## Goals

This workshop will focus on 2D pixel art in a top-down RPG style. It will start with simply creating a character that can walk around a scene. This may eventually be expanded to include creating dialogue, fighting enemies, and other such elements.
