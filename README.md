# Unity Workshop

For those who are interested in Unity but don't know where to start.

## Set Up

First, download and install Unity. The [personal edition](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) of Unity is all you need for this. 

You'll also need to create a Unity account. You can either do that on the website or after you open up the Unity program.
